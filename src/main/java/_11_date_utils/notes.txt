In java8 we have brand new date and time api.
UTC: 
    Coordinated universal time.(time keeping for civil world)
    used by computed servers, ATC, space station etc.
    typical utc day has 86400 seconds
    measured by automic clocks
    BIPM finalizes time.

Legacy code:
    java.util.Date
    java.util.Calender
    java.util.GregorianCalender
    java.util.TimeZone

    java.util.Date
        For June 8th 2016, we represent like: new Date(116, 5, 8), (uses 1900 as start of year)

Commonly used classes in New api:
    All these classes implement Temporal class.
        LocalDate
        LocalTime
        LocalDateTime
        ZonedDateTIme
        Instant
    Below clsses implements TemporalAmount
        Duration & Period
            (duration b/w two points of time, it will be diff b/w two instances of Instant class)
            Period: interval b/w two dates, (ex: compute age of person)
            period is associated with date and duration is associated with time.
    
    ISO-8601 format: [date]T[time][zone offset]
    ex: 2017-07-03T01:00-7:00[Ametica/Los_Angeles]
    2017-07-03T01:Z[UTC] : z implies UTC/GMT
