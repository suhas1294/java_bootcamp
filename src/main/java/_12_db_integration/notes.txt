Design database:
    Normalization (to address redundency)
    Normalization rules:
        1NF - first normal form
        2nf
        3nf
        bcnf(boyce codd normal form)
        4nf, 5nf, 6nf

    SQL statements classification:
        DML (data manipulation language): select, insert, udpate, delete
        DDL (data definition language):
            create database, create table, create index
            alter table, alter index,
            drop database, drop table, drop index
    
    JDBC - its an api
        It can be used to interact with Databases(Mysql), tabular(excel sheet) etc
        We need to use JDBC driver to connect JDBC api to actual database.
        We have JDBC for different purposes:
            JDBC for Mysql
            JDBC for Oracle server
            JDBC for ..
        Drivers can be classified into : 
            type1 (jdvbc-odbc bridge driver) 
            type2 (jdbc native api driver)
            type3 (jdbc net driver)
            type4 (jdbc driver)
