Overriding rules:

concepts of early binding and late binding.

static variables and static methods are early binded. (at the time of compilation)
instance variables and instance methods are late binded (at the run time, as instances are created at runtime)

Method binding:
	invokestatic (for static methods)
	invokeVirtual (for instance method)

what is not overridden ?
	final methods
	fields : instance & static
	static methods : ALWAYS super class's static method will be called since it is early bound during compilation time.


Prevent inheritance :  use final keyword on class name
prevent inheritance & instantiation : make the constructor private. (Math utility class)
