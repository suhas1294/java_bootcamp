How to decide which one is super class and which one is subclass ?
    IS-A test
    HAS-A

Polymorphism:
    User user = new Editor()
    Reference type  objectIdentifier = ActualObject

    Compiler looks at Reference type while compiling, But at runtime -
    JVM starts looking for object type from bottom of inheritance tree to decide which method to be called.
