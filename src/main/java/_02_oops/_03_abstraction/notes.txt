Scenario:
	we want inheritance (so we cant use final keyword / private constructor)
	we dont want method implementation

nature of abstract class:
	to generic to be instantiated
	contains methods for which there is no implementation
	defines contract/protocol for its subclasses
	uses 'abstract' keyword
	'abstract' keyword can be used at method level as well. (cannot have absrtact method in non abstract class)
	implementation should be provided by subclasses
	cannot be decalred static
	useless unless its extended.
	can contain 1 or more concreate methods(implemented methods)

Abstract subclass
	Even sub class coule be decalred subclass
	subclass can override methods
	can contain 1 or more concreate methods(implemented methods)

concrete subclass:
	must override unimplemented methods

Item 20: prefered class hirerchies to tagger classes
